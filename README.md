# CoastSat_Package Repo
:warning: This package is still under active development :warning:

## Install CoastSat with Pip
[PyPi Repo](https://pypi.org/project/coastsat-package/)
- Note: This package is still in beta and being actively developed.
1. Create a conda environment
- We will install the CoastSat package and its dependencies in this environment.
	> `conda create --name coastsat_pkg -y`	
2. Activate your conda environment
	>`conda activate coastsat_pkg `	
3. Install geopandas with Conda
	- [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) has [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) as a dependency so its best to install it with conda.
	>`conda install geopandas -y`
4. Install pip in your conda environment
- We will use pip to install the coastsat package from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
	>  `conda install pip -y`
5. Install the pip package
- `-U` (upgrade flag) this gets the latest release of the CoastSat package
	> `pip install coastsat_package -U`


## Current Problems with the CoastSat Package
1. **GDAL Dependency**
CoastSat relies on `geopandas` as a dependency which in turn has `GDAL` . `GDAL` is a uncompiled source distribution which means the user has to build GDAL on their system if they want to use the official release. Alternatively users can download a precompiled python wheel for their OS from [Christoph Gohlkeâ€™s website](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal).
2. **ReadMe is not compatible with PyPi**
In order to allow the ReadMe to be uploaded to PyPi I had to remove a few sections of the readme that weren't compatible. I kept the original Readme but renamed it to `READMEgithub.md`.
3. **Conda has to be used to Install CoastSat**
Due to CoastSat's dependency on geopandas conda has to be used to install the pip package. This also means the user has to install the dependencies in the exact order I described in the earlier section `install coastsat with pip` otherwise errors are likely to occur.

## Solutions
1. **GDAL Dependency**
For now I've found the easist solution is to install `geopandas` with `conda` as it takes care of the dirty work of creating a compatible environment for `geopandas` and `GDAL`. The downside of this approach is it means the user will have to run the commands to install `geopandas`,`pip`, and `coastsat_pkg` in a that exact order. When I tried the order  `pip`,  `coastsat_pkg`, then `geopandas` the installation failed on my windows machine.

	In the future I hope we can put the dependency for geopandas in the same pip package or conda package as coastsat but for now this solution works. Maybe we could detect what OS the user has and install the corresponding GDAL wheel on their system so that we can have geopandas as a pip dependency?

### Project description

Satellite remote sensing can provide low-cost long-term shoreline data capable of resolving the temporal scales of interest to coastal scientists and engineers at sites where no in-situ field measurements are available. CoastSat enables the non-expert user to extract shorelines from Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Landsat 9 and Sentinel-2 images.
The shoreline detection algorithm implemented in CoastSat is optimised for sandy beach coastlines. It combines a sub-pixel border segmentation and an image classification component, which refines the segmentation into four distinct categories such that the shoreline detection is specific to the sand/water interface.

The toolbox has four main functionalities:

1. assisted retrieval from Google Earth Engine of all available satellite images spanning the user-defined region of interest and time period.
2. automated extraction of shorelines from all the selected images using a sub-pixel resolution technique.
3. intersection of the 2D shorelines with user-defined shore-normal transects.
4. tidal correction using measured water levels and an estimate of the beach slope.
5. post-processing of the shoreline time-series, despiking and seasonal averaging.
6. validation example at Narrabeen
